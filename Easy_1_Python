1. Nested for loops iterate over all possible combinations of pairs of numbers from the nums list.
2. The outer loop iterates over the elements of the nums list from the beginning to the end.
3. The inner loop iterates over the elements of the nums list starting from the element following the current element of the outer loop (thus avoiding duplicate combinations).
4. For each combination of a pair of numbers, it checks whether their sum equals the target value target.
5. If the sum equals target, it returns the indices of these two numbers in the form of a tuple (i, j).
6. If there is no match, it moves on to the next combination.
